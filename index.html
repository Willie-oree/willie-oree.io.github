    <p>Willie Eldon O'Ree, CM ONB (born October 15, 1935) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, known best for being the first black player in the National Hockey League. O'Ree played as a 
    winger for the Boston Bruins. O'Ree is referred to as the "Jackie Robinson of ice hockey" due to breaking the black colour barrier in the sport,
     and has stated publicly that he had met Jackie Robinson twice in his own younger years.

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right"></span></p>
    <p>Midway through his second minor-league season with the Quebec Aces,
     O'Ree was called up to the Boston Bruins of the NHL to replace an injured player. 
     O'Ree was 95% blind in his right eye due to being hit there by an errant puck two years earlier,
      which normally would have precluded him from playing in the NHL. 
      However, O'Ree managed to keep it secret, and made his NHL debut with the Bruins on January 18, 1958,
       against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the first black player in league history, appearing in two games that year,
        and came back in 1961 to play 43 games, playing with Boston centreman Don McKenney and right wing Jerry Toppazzini. 
        He scored 4 goals and 10 assists in his NHL career, all in 1961</p><br>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right"></span> </p>
    <p>After O'Ree's stint in the NHL, 
     there were no other black players in the NHL until another Canadian player,
     Mike Marson, was drafted by the Washington Capitals in 1974. 
     There were 23 black players in the NHL as of the mid-2010s, 
     the most prominent being P. K. Subban. Art Dorrington was the first black player to sign an NHL contract, 
     in 1950 with the New York Rangers organization,
     but never played beyond the minor league level. 
     NHL players are now required to enroll in a preseason diversity training seminar,
     and racially based verbal abuse is punished through suspensions and fines.

    <p>O'Ree was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1984. 
    In 1998, O'Ree was working at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, 
    California when the National Hockey League approached him to be the director of youth development for its diversity task force.
     The NHL/USA Hockey Diversity Task Force is a non-profit program for minority youth that encourages them to learn and play hockey. 
     As of the mid-2000s, O'Ree lives in Berkeley, California.</p>
